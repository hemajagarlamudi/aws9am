NAT : Network Address Translator
DHCP : Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol


Default VPC : Userfriendly
--> All subnets are Internet facing.
--> We cannot manage IP range.
--> Every region contains one Default VPC.
--> If you delete it, We can get it with single click. 


CustomVPC : 
--> We can configure Public SUbnets and Private Subnets.
--> We can choose required IP range.
--> We can create a VPC with required customisations. 

Public SUbnets : Internet facing
Private Subnets : Non-Internet facing



Max CIDR support for VPC is /16


Step 1 : Create a CustomVPC : CIDR 192.168.0.0/16

--> When we create a VPC, we will get "Main Route table", Default Security Group, Default NACL


Step 2 : Create Subnets under default VPC

	Public SUbnet : ap-south-1a: 192.168.100.0/24
	Private Subnet : ap-south-1b : 192.168.200.0/24

Step 3: Create an "InternetGateway" and Associate to Custom VPC

Step 4 : Configure the RouteTables accordingly.

	4.1 Create a New Route and Perform SubnetAssociation (ap-south-1a)
	4.2 Add a route 0.0.0.0/0 --> InternetGateway

Now, private subnet is member of Main Route table automatically, as main routetable don't have any Internet provides (IGW) with route, it treated as private subnet.


Step 5 (Optional) : Enable "AutoAssign Public Ip" setting on Public Subnet.


ENable Internet for Private Subnet ec2 instances. (OS Patches, Application required internet, api calls to internet hosted application)

NAT Instance (Free Tier) : Dev/test
--> This is an ec2 instance desgined to perform NAT operations.
--> We need to launch this in our CUSTOMVPC's PUBLIC SUBNET.
--> As it is an ec2 instance, We need to take care about Security Groups (http, https).
--> We need to DISABLE SOURCE/DESTINATION check.

--> If internet is bottleneck, Increase the instance configuration.

--> We need to edit the ROuteTables accordingly.


NAT Gateway (No Free Tier) : Prod

--> Create a NATGateway and associate an EIP.
--> Edit the route tables accordingly. 

--> If we are using IPv6, To provide internet to Private subnet instance "Egress Only Internet Gateway".


Logs : 

ELB : AccessLogs
VPC : FlowLogs

--> We can store logs to "Cloudwatch logs group" and "S3Bucket"


NACL : 
--> NACL are Stateless. We need to takes care about Inbound and outbound rules. 
--> We can allow/deny traffic.

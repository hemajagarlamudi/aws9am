Multi-AZ deployement : Another copy of our DB instance runs in Another AZ in same Region.

Read Replica: Read only copy. 
--> It can perform only Readonly operations.



Task 1 : https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/projects/deploy-wordpress-with-amazon-rds/

Task 2 : Launch an MSSQL Express edition in RDS and Launch a instance in Public subnet , Install SSMS (SQL Server Management Studio) and connect RDS using endpoint.



Backup on RDS: Snapshots

--> Automatic Snapshots : If we enable "automatic backup", we will get these. We cannot delete AS. AWS creates these AS, when it detects any major changes on db.

--> Manual Snapshots : We need to create manually. Need to delete manually.



Restore from s3: Aurora and Mysql
--> Percona Xtra backup



Amazon Aurora : AWS's own Database..

--> Server : With Writer and Readers
--> Serverless : Give required RAM capacity

Regional : You provision your Aurora database in a single AWS Region.

Global : You can provision your Aurora database in multiple AWS Regions. Writes in the primary AWS Region are replicated with typical latency of less than 1 sec to secondary AWS Regions.
